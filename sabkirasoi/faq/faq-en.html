</div>
<div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>With a resolve that no one loses their battle to hunger during the pan-India lockdown enforced due to COVID -19 pandemic, I-PAC has started its new initiative Sabki Rasoi — a virtual kitchen for people in urgent need of food for their survival. The initiative will start on Sunday, 5th April, 2020, and in its first phase of 10 days, will serve at least 15 lakh meals (up to 1.5 lakh meals a day) across 20-25 cities in India.</p>

</div>
<div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>To deliver 1.5 Lakh meals daily in 20-25 cities, I-PAC is collaborating with three sets of partners in the domains of - food preparation (large kitchens), packaging and delivery (food logistics), and food distribution (grassroots feeding organisations).</p>

</a> </h4>
</div>
<div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>All partners of this initiative are committed, and will make every possible effort, to strictly adhere to the government rules and guidelines for the lockdown. They will ensure complete compliance with the mandated norms of social distancing and will take precautions to avoid crowding in public and semi-public places. Additionally, the food distribution partners will make extra efforts in this regard, as they will be potentially dealing with large numbers of people on-ground.</p>

<h4 class="panel-title"> <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse4">4. Why has I-PAC decided to help the people affected by the lockdown by providing food?
</a> </h4>
</div>
<div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted immense misery and suffering on people. Though unintended, the consequences of the pan-India lockdown have had a crippling effect, especially on those belonging to the bottom of the pyramid— migrant labourers, daily-wage earners, and homeless. While the government is trying to do its best, given the enormity of the need, their resources are also stretched. This unprecedented situation calls for people to rise to the occasion as a community, and provide relief to the distressed. I-PAC believes that people who are in a position to help, must not let those in need go hungry for the want of individual or collective efforts.</p>
